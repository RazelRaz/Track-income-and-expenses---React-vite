# React Income and Expense Tracker

Welcome to the Income and Expense Tracker web application! This is a React-based personal finance tool that allows users to easily keep track of their income and expenses in a user-friendly and intuitive way.


## Features

- **Income Transactions:** Use the "Income" page to add details of your income transactions. Enter the source, amount, and date of your income, and the application will store and display the data in a list.

- **Expense Transactions:** On the "Expense" page, you can enter information about your expenses. Provide the expense source, amount, and date, and the application will maintain a separate list for all your expenses.

- **React Router DOM:** The application uses React Router DOM for smooth navigation between the "Income" and "Expense" pages. Simply click the navigation links in the Navbar to switch between the two views.

- **Responsive Design:** The Income and Expense Tracker is designed with responsiveness in mind. It looks great and functions well on various devices, from desktops to tablets and mobile phones.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the "Income" page to add your income transactions. Fill out the source (e.g., salary, freelance work, etc.), the amount earned, and the date of the income.

2. Switch to the "Expense" page in the Navbar to add your expense transactions. Enter the expense source (e.g., groceries, rent, etc.), the amount spent, and the date of the expense.

3. Submit the form on either page to add the transaction, and it will be displayed in the corresponding list.

4. View the updated lists of income and expenses to keep track of your financial activities.
